Discuss . Multi-processing and Multi-threading in Python. What is GIL?

GIL(Global Interpreter Lock)-
It is a mutex(or a lock) that allows only one thread to hold the control of the Python interpreter. This means that only one thread can be in state of execution at any point in time.


Multi-threading -

The multithreading is a lightweight, shares memory, responsible for responsive UI and is used well for I/O bound applications.
Multiple threads live in the same process in the same space, each thread will do a specific task, have its own code, own memory, 
instruction pointer,and share heap memory.

Threads run in the same unique memory heap.

MultiProcessing -

Multiprocessing refers to the ability of a system to support more than one processor at the same time. 
In python, multiprocseeing uses seperate memory space, multiple CPU cores, bypasses GIL limitations in CPython.
